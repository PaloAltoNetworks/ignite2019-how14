# Securing Kubernetes in Google Cloud (Ignite 2019 HOW14 lab)

In this lab, we will secure kubernetes/container environment by scanning container images for vulnerabilities, scanning kubernetes manifests for security misconfiguration. 
Once deployed, we will protect container to container traffic (East-West) and internet to container traffic (North-South) using VM-series firewall
